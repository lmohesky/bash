# Bash Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts that I've created to automate various tasks and operations on Unix-based systems. Each script is well-documented and follows best practices for writing Bash scripts.

## Contents

- **system**: Scripts for system administration tasks, such as user management, process monitoring, and system cleanup.
- **network**: Scripts for network-related tasks, including network configuration, port scanning, and traffic analysis.
- **file_management**: Scripts for managing files and directories, such as file compression, archiving, and synchronization.
- **utilities**: General-purpose utility scripts for tasks like text processing, file conversions, and more.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you'll need a Unix-based system with Bash installed. Most scripts can be run directly from the command line, and many of them accept command-line arguments for customization. Detailed usage instructions are provided in the comments at the beginning of each script.

## Contributing
